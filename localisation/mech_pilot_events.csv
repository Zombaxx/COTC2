EVTDESCbuy_mech.1;You have purchased a piloting license and are now authorized to pilot a Combat Mech Suit. Be careful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.1;This is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbuy_mech.2;You have commisioned your Spymaster with the task of finding and purchasing a Combat Mech Suit for your own personal use. There are many Zhao Rangers on the market, and for the right price you have acquired one for yourself. You anxiously await its delivery to you at the gates of [Root.Capital.GetName], but even still as it arrives you can't help but almost faint. Two stories tall, wide, golden, with claws the size of an ox and creaking ungodly noises from its orifices, your Zhao Ranger Mech Suit is as fearsome as you had hoped it would look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.2;I will dominate the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buy_mech.3;Red Fighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbuy_mech.3;You meet your contact, a Cetinese trader with a mechanic eye, at a hangar not too far from your capital. "They're masterworks, all. You can't go wrong," he says as he unveils his 'toys' for you to see. He presents to you a tall metal hulk, a beastly giant iron almost in the shape of a man, its exterior harder than any sword you've felt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTbuy_mech.4;The world is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.1;You have entrusted your spare Mech Suit to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. "Thank you," [Root.GetSheHe] says, bowing to express [Root.GetHerHis] gratitude.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.1;Hopefully, they don't don't use it against me...;;;x

EVTTITsuit_events.0;Mind and Body;;;x
EVTDESCsuit_events; With each engagement you get better and better at fighting inside your Mech suit. However, Piloting an Armored Mech Suit is heavily taxing on the human body. Due to having to connect to the pilot's spine every use, over time the Mech Suit can kill its pilot.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.0;Such is life.;;;x
suitevt1;Piloting your Mech Suit takes a toll on your health.;;;x
EVTOPTBsuit_events.0;I was born for this!;;;x
suitevt2;You are unaffected by your suit's life draining mechanics;;;x
EVTOPTCsuit_events.0;I am one with my Machine!;;;x
suitevt3;Unlike most pilots, you are unaffected by the drawbacks of extensive fighting. You are more closely bonded with your Mech Suit.;;;x
good_pilot;Good Pilot;;;x
good_pilot_desc;This character handles their Mech Suit well.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.2;As an Emperor, it simply will not do to pilot a standard Mech Suit like every other Commander. No, you have tasked your researchers with developing an AP-6 STRIKER. At last, their construction is complete and you can now pilot her yourself if you can handle it...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.2;All will bow to me!;;;x
suitevt3;Your Mech Suit is scrapped to build an AP-6 STRIKER;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.3;In the heat of battle, you and your men encounter your enemy [roboduel.GetFirstName]'s Mech Suit wreaking great havoc among your lines. Unlike anything you've ever seen, the creature kills scores of men with just one swoop of its gigantic metal claws. Watching your men demoralized and fleeing, you contemplate going for a charge...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.3;No, that would be too dangerous.;;;x
EVTOPTBsuit_events.3; May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] guide my sword to victory. Charge!!!;;;x
suitevt4;You charge forward and face the metal beast on your own.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.4;By the grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], you managed to narrowly dodge an attack from the metal demon, ramming your lance right into where it hides its master. The beast groans and staggers, ejecting its master [roboduel.GetFirstName] from its chest and falling to pieces.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.4;Men will sing songs of this day for years to come!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.5;Before you could make it to the beast, one sweep of its claw knocks you off your horse and flings you into the air. You land on your back, a great distance from where you once were, alive, but badly injured.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.5;My leg...!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.6;By the grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], you managed to narrowly dodge an attack from the metal demon, ramming your lance right into where it hides its master. The beast groans and staggers. As you pull your lance away, you realize you have impaled the beast's master [roboduel.GetFirstName] and killed [roboduel.GetHerHim]. It is now yours to claim.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.6;To the victor, the spoils...;;;x
