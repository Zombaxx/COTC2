EVTNAMEDTE33300;A Collegial Decision;x
EVTDESCDTE33300;Now that you are coming of age, you have the option to continue your education and further bolster your skills. This will mean additional years of schooling, not to mention paying tuition, but it is a definite opportunity.;x
EVTOPTADTE33300;I will pay my own way.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33300;I'll ask my father for help.;x
EVTOPTCDTE33300;I'll ask my mother for help.;x
EVTOPTDDTE33300;I'll ask our leader for help.;x
EVTOPTEDTE33300;I'll work to earn the tuition.;x
EVTOPTFDTE33300;I'll pass.;x
EVTDESCDTE33301;I would like to attend college, but I need your approval and support to do it. Will you assist me? I assure you I will apply myself faithfully to my studies and make you proud.;x
EVTOPTADTE33301;I shall help them.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33301;I will not help them.;
EVTDESCDTE33302;I have decided to assist you in going to college. Take this money for tuition, and make us all proud.;x
EVTOPTADTE33302;Thank you! Thank you!;x
EVTDESCDTE33303;Unfortunately, I cannot assist you. I'm sorry, but you'll have to find another way.;x
EVTOPTADTE33303;I'll have to work for the tuition.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33303;I give up!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33304;Earning Your Way;x
EVTDESCDTE33304;After months of doing odd jobs, everything from washing vehicles to cooking meat, I have finally earned enough to afford college tuition.;x
EVTOPTADTE33304;Finally. College, here I come!;x
EVTOPTBDTE33304;You know, this just proves I don't need a degree.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33305;Choosing Your Major;x
EVTDESCDTE33305;Your application to a local place of higher education has been accepted. Now, you need to decide what you'll be studying for the next several years. You have many choices, so choose carefully.;x

EVTOPTDDTE33305;Hmm...something else...;x
EVTNAMEDTE33310;Matriculation;x
EVTDESCDTE33310;The time has finally come for your formal entry into college. Now we shall see what your intellect is made of - and whether you get triggered by somebody misusing prepositions. Just be careful over the next few years - you don't want to get probation, or flunk out entirely!;x
EVTOPTADTE33310;Let's go!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33321;A Boring Lecture;x
EVTDESCDTE33321;During an especially boring lecture, you feel yourself start to drift off into sleep. You stayed up late last night...studying...and did not get nearly enough sleep. This could be your chance to catch up...but what if you get caught?;x
EVTOPTADTE33321;No, I must stay awake!;x
EVTOPTBDTE33321;Zzzzz...;x
EVTNAMEDTE33322;The Unjust Professor;x
EVTDESCDTE33322;One more paper from that man, one more failing grade without cause. You've tried talking about it with him and working with other students, but it's become clear the professor just has it out for you. How much longer can you bear it?;x
EVTOPTADTE33322;I'll make it up elsewhere...;x
EVTOPTBDTE33322;No, I must make a stand!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33323;The All-Nighter;x
EVTDESCDTE33323;You really shouldn't have put things off, but here you are: it's late, your eyes are heavy, and you're nowhere near ready for that exam tomorrow morning. You're already sleep deprived and can't skip another night healthily, but...;x
EVTOPTADTE33323;Until dawn if I have to.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33323;I can't keep my eyes open...;x
EVTNAMEDTE33324;An Early Start;x
EVTDESCDTE33324;Your coursework has aligned just right so you aren't too heavily burdened right now. You could use this opportunity to get a head start on some work due in a couple months, but there's also a great party being thrown tonight.;x
EVTOPTADTE33324;I should attend to my work.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33324;I've earned a break.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33325;Chug! Chug! Chug!;x
EVTDESCDTE33325;You're enjoying yourself at the party of the year when someone brings out a keg with a bizarre contraption attached. When you ask about it, it is explained to be a tool for imbibing as much alcohol as possible in as little time as possible.;x
EVTOPTADTE33325;Err...I have to go.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33325;I volunteer as tribute!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33326;A Harmless Prank;x
EVTDESCDTE33326;You've been hanging out with friends, and as the sun sets, you've all had a few drinks. Then, as darkness settles, one person suggests the group should vandalize one of the statues on campus. Perhaps we could paint vulgar slogans all over it?;x
EVTOPTADTE33326;I'm going to leave now...;x
EVTOPTBDTE33326;Let's do this!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33327;A Chance Encounter;x
EVTDESCDTE33327;While at a party, you hit it off with a [Root.GetBoyGirlOpp]. As you converse and laugh over things, all while getting increasingly inebriated, [Root.GetSheHeOpp] suggests you retire to another room. A private room.;x
EVTOPTADTE33327;I'm sorry, I'm not that kind of [Root.GetBoyGirl].;x
EVTOPTBDTE33327;Ah yes, somebody's about to get lucky!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33328;A Questionable Opportunity;x
EVTDESCDTE33328;While at a party, you've been drinking and drinking just like everybody else. But you've noticed that one of the [Root.GetBoyGirlOpp]s has had way too much and is on the verge of passing out. A dark thought occurs to you...;x
EVTOPTADTE33328;I'm no rapist!;x
EVTOPTBDTE33328;Well, they can't say no...;x
EVTNAMEDTE33329;The Dreaded Cafeteria;x
EVTDESCDTE33329;On campus, there are two main options for food: you can either prepare food yourself or eat at the cafeteria. The cafeteria is a good place to dine with friends and you can get a lot of food, but the quality is honestly pretty bad.;x
EVTOPTADTE33329;I'll just eat at home.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33329;I'm sure Saga Syndrome is a myth.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33330;Prospective Students;x
EVTDESCDTE33330;As you go from one appointment to another on campus, you notice a gaggle of younger people following a member of the college's administration. You realize these are prospective students touring the campus - time for a prank?;x
EVTOPTADTE33330;No, I shouldn't mess with them.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33330;Hey, ask to see the rape chamber!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33331;Meeting With Donors;x
EVTDESCDTE33331;Some prominent donors who support the college's mission are touring campus, but ask to speak with a student to get the "real story" about life on campus - and you drew the short straw. Hmmm...maybe this is an opportunity in disguise.;x
EVTOPTADTE33331;I'll just be frank but polite.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33331;Oh, please, they're starving us!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33332;Free Movie Night;x
EVTDESCDTE33332;One of the clubs on campus has got an old projector working and is planning on showing an old movie they dug up from before the War. It sounds like fun, but you have work you need to do. Decisions, decisions...;x
EVTOPTADTE33332;Ah, I should focus on my work.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33332;A movie sounds fantastic!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33333;An Old Play;x
EVTDESCDTE33333;Some members of the college are putting on a play - some old work of Shakespeare. You always found that stuff a little too dense an difficult to enjoy, but you somehow get roped into going anyway. Sigh...;x
EVTOPTADTE33333;Eh, I should learn to appreciate even what I don't enjoy.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33333;"Villain, I have done thy mother?" Maybe this isn't so bad...;x
EVTNAMEDTE33334;An Art Show;x
EVTDESCDTE33334;A number of the artists around campus have compiled their works into a single, grand presentation. Honestly, most of it is garbage. But just as you think that, one those artists asks your opinion.;x
EVTOPTADTE33334;I'm sorry, but I hate it.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33334;I love the commentary on existential nebulousness.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33335;Time At The Library;x
EVTDESCDTE33335;In order to research a topic for an upcoming paper, you've gone to the college library. But as you leaf through books on your topic, you start to get bored...and remember you saw a section full of saucy comic books.;x
EVTOPTADTE33335;No, I need to research.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33335;Well, I should research how saucy is saucy.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33336;Walking Among Eagles;x
EVTDESCDTE33336;One day, as you stroll across campus, you are suddenly struck by the statues - especially the eagles. As you contemplate them, you feel something stirring in your chest. It's a silly sentimental moment, but there it is.;x
EVTOPTADTE33336;I am inspired to seek justice.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33336;Just silly sentiment - who needs it?;x
EVTNAMEDTE33337;The Start of Break;x
EVTDESCDTE33337;While you're hard at work throughout the year, there are breaks interspersed in that time. One has just started, and several of your friends want to use it as a chance to go totally nuts with partying, alcohol, and sex.;x
EVTOPTADTE33337;I just need a break to rest.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33337;Oh, I need this so bad.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33338;A Campus Protest;x
EVTDESCDTE33338;As some of your friends have studied, they've become more consciousness of injustices in the world. Now, they want to organize a protest against all the wrongs of the world, complete with signs and slogans and drums.;x
EVTOPTADTE33338;Right on, fight the power!;x
EVTOPTBDTE33338;That won't acheive anything.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33339;Hate Speech?;x
EVTDESCDTE33339;As you watch two people talking across the way, you notice that a crowd is gathering as the couple get louder and louder. Apparently, one of them said something apparently hateful, and the other is demanding mob retribution.;x
EVTOPTADTE33339;Free expression is sacred on these grounds.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33339;There's no room for such wicked ideas here.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33340;A Holy Terra Missionary;x
EVTDESCDTE33340;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into a Holy Terra missionary, who is telling you that all mankind is sinful, but can be redeemed and justified through his God who died for us. He eagerly hands you a small Bible.;x
EVTOPTADTE33340;Amen, brother.;x
EVTOPTBDTE33340;What nonsense.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33341;A Terraformed Prosyletizer;x
EVTDESCDTE33341;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into a member of a local cult, who is telling you that men can reach out to powers greater than his imagination to receive greatness. He eagerly hands you a tract on his favorite.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33342;A Seaborne Orator;x
EVTDESCDTE33342;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into an orator promoting Legalism, telling you that society will never return to greatness until it embraces peaceful cooperation and the rule of law. He hands you a pacifist tract.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33343;An Militarist Orator;x
EVTDESCDTE33343;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into an orator promoting Militarism, telling you that society must rise through strong men seizing power and disposessing the weak. He hands you a tract on the tyranny of the week.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33344;A Economist Orator;x
EVTDESCDTE33344;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into an orator promoting Economism, telling you that life will not be sweet again until we embrace the materialist capitalism that built the old world. He solicits a donation.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33345;A Conspiracy Theorist;x
EVTDESCDTE33345;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into an orator promoting conspiracy theories, telling you that the world belongs to the crafty, and that an intellectual elite should rule the world. He hands you a sheet of tin foil.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33346;A Scientist Orator;x
EVTDESCDTE33346;You encounter many ideas on campus, but today you run into an orator promoting Scientism, telling you that only the scientific method can provide a way to rebuild society and establish a golden age of knowledge. He hands you numbers.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33397;Academic Troubles;x
EVTDESCDTE33397A;Because of problems with your recent academic or disciplinary record, you have been placed under probation. If your record continues to deterioriate in the near future, you may be expelled from college.;x
EVTDESCDTE33397B;Your academic or disciplinary record has been so bad that the college has had no choice but to expel you. You may not re-apply to this or any other institute of higher learning for another decade.;x
EVTOPTADTE33397;Alas.;x
EVTNAMEDTE33398;Graduation!;x
EVTDESCDTE33398A;After four years of hard work, you've finally made it: you've earned a bachelor's degree, marking you as part of an intellectual elite. Now is the time to get out into the world and put your knowledge to use.;x 
EVTDESCDTE33398B;After four years of hard work, you've finally made it: you've earned a bachelor's degree, marking you as part of an intellectual elite. You can now go out into the world, but you've also been offered a chance for a higher degree.;x
EVTOPTADTE33398;Finally, I'm done with school!;x
EVTOPTBDTE33398;I must learn more. Four more years!;x
EVTNAMEDTE33399;Graduation 2.0!;x
EVTDESCDTE33399;After four more years of hard work, you've really and truly made it: a doctoral degree, setting you among the elite of the elite. Now is the time to get out into the world and put your knowledge to use.;x
EVTOPTADTE33399;Doctor [Root.GetDynName]. I like the sound of that.;x
