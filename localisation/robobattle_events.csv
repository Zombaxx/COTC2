EVTDESCrobobattle_events.10;Unfortunately, you did not have the skill to take on your opponent and their Mech Suit. After bludgeoning your machine until it would no longer respond, your opponent began ripping your Mech Suit apart, clawing their way to the cockpit. You manage to eject yourself from the cockpit and escape, but your Mechanized Armor is destroyed by [roboduel.GetFirstName]. You'll need time to heal after a fight like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTArobobattle_events.10;I'll get you next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCrobobattle_events.11;You and your opponent dance around one another for what seems like forever in your Mech Suits, trying desperately to maneuver out of the way of the deadly shots and swings being thrown. Alas, you find a blind spot and ram your machine's claw right through your enemy, disabling it for good. Unfortunately, the pilot managed to retreat with their life before you could finish them off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTArobobattle_events.11;Flee, coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
