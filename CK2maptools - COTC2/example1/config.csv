#SETTING;VALUE
#START_YEAR;Target year for which to generate history.
#MOD_FOLDER;Folder of your mod, or of the base game. Used only to read cultures.
#HEIGHTS;Tweak these to alter terrain height. Default values 125,150,175,200. Each one should be higher than the last and all should be higher than 96.
hills_height;118
mountains_height;139
snow_height;163
peak_height;190
#INPUT_MAP_SCALE;How much smaller the input.bmp and climate.bmp are compared to the provinces.bmp. Higher value means lower resolution. Defaults to 2, meaning the provinces.bmp is twice as large as input.bmp
input_map_scale;2
#TREE_MAP_SCALE;How much smaller the tree.bmp is compared to the provinces.bmp. Higher value means lower resolution, fewer trees and better in-game performance. Defaults to 6, meaning the provinces.bmp is 6 times as large as the tree.bmp.
tree_map_scale;4
#NOISE;Params for randomness in terrain height. For each square of noise_patch_size pixels, a random number rand is chosen between 0 and noise_factor_max.
#NOISE;Final terrain height for each pixel is equal to [base_height + (noise_baseline + base_height - water_height) * rand]
#NOISE;[peak_height + (noise_baseline + peak_height - 96) * (noise_factor_max)] should not be much higher than 255
#NOISE;A higher patch size will make the terrain more uniform. A lower size will increase bumpiness.
noise_patch_size;4
#NOISE;A higher factor will increase height variations, especially on higher terrain.
noise_factor_max;0.5
#NOISE;A higher baseline will increase height variations. This effect will be equally pronounced on low or high terrain.
noise_baseline;15
#SMOOTHING;A higher number means smoother, flatter terrain, but also more time to process. Low numbers will lead to steep, artificial transitions between mountain types.
smooth_radius;6
#PROVINCES;The minimum distance between 2 settlements when using the filling tool. A greater number will generate larger provinces
settlements_min_distance;33
#PROVINCES;The minimum distance between 2 sea nodes when using the filling tool. A greater number will generate larger sea zones
sea_nodes_min_distance;100
#ADJACENCIES;Used for adjacencies calculations. Maximum squared distance between 2 provinces that can allow a strait.
max_strait_distance;24
#RULERS;Percentage of female rulers to generate (feudal/tribal only)
percent_female;10
#CUSTOM_TERRAIN;There are 2 unused terrains in the game's terrain.bmp, you can use them and define their properties (for the tools) here
#CUSTOM_TERRAIN;Color by which the terrain is identified in input.bmp. custom_terrain_1 will map to index 13 and custom_terrain_2 will map to index 14
custom_terrain_1_input_color;128;255;255
custom_terrain_2_input_color;0;128;128
#CUSTOM_TERRAIN;Initial height for each custom terrain type. Note : th tool turns all terrain into hills/mountains or their desert equivalents above certain height levels, so keep this below hills_height as defined above
custom_terrain_1_height;96
custom_terrain_2_height;96
#CUSTOM_TERRAIN;Color of the terrain's texture on the colormap.dds
custom_terrain_1_colormap;128;160;160
custom_terrain_2_colormap;96;104;64
#CUSTOM_TERRAIN;Used for province holding slots calculations. For comparison : farmlands=8, plains=4, forest=2, steppe=2, hills=2, arctic=1, desert=0
custom_terrain_1_wealth;0
custom_terrain_2_wealth;2
