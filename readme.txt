To install, place the COTC2 folder and COTC2.mod file into Documents->Paradox Interactive->Crusader Kings II->mod. Now launch Crusader Kings 2, and select Western Pacific in the mod options.
Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting or the provided save file will crash the game.

COTC2 currently only works with the provided save file, or with the Random World game mode available through the Holy Fury DLC (at the bookmark screen choose Custom Game Setup, and select the Randomize World button between the Year and the Merchant Republic list).

If you would like to use the provided save file instead of Random World, take the random_657941809.ck2 and Byiga1089_01_21.ck2 files from within mod folder in Documents->Paradox Interactive->Crusader Kings II->mod->COTC2 and place it into Crusader Kings II->COTC2->save games (so this is the COTC2 folder one level above the mod folder, not the one inside the mod folder).

Backstory:
Long after the Crisis, the Imperialist Coup, the renaissance of Neo-Feudalism across the colonized galaxy, and the dubious survival against the Hiver onslaught, the galaxy went silent for a time with the devestation of a cosmic hypernova permeating the primary navigation network of known space, temporarily disabling most Jump Gates for generations and permanently breaking others. With the primary trade networks broken down the interstellar ships, known as Tunnelers, alone were unable to continue transporting enough materials to sustain most interstellar travel and many other aspects of what was once modern life in the ashes of the once vast Terran Empire, bringing on a new dark age for humanity. The gates within some lucky star clusters came back online much sooner than others, which trickled back online over a millennia.\n\n1066 years later the majority of Jump Gates have come back online, religions rather than ideologies rule the minds of the galaxy once again, and feudal lords rule the stars in a divided galaxy. Only the neutral Spacer's Guild know to pilot the Tunneler ships needed for interstellar travel beyond the Jump Gate Networks, or produce the cybernetics that many of the nobles have grown to rely on.

Long ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky.
Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.
Around 1000 years later the Western Pacific is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. 
Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of Earth, arrived in orbit.
